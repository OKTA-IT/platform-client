Used cases that are covered in this setup

* Salesforce sources have same mapping rules but with different id and different order.
* Uses cases for Sitemp sources
  - different extensions attached to the source
  - basic configuration variation (startingAddresses and addressPatterns)
  - configuration parameter variation (RespectRobotsDotTxt)
  - mapping with item type
  - mapping with array in rule
  - added, updated and deleted rules

* Uses cases for the web source
  - Configuration modification that should not impact the diff (id, resourceId, userIdentities, owner).
